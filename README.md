# Naruto Real Estates
 Creating a Machine Learning Model to provide optimal predictions/solution to Naruto Real Estates

The Experts of "Naruto Real Estates" are not able to make optimal predictions for the Company and due to wrong manual predictions Company is getting loss day by day.
So, we have to make a Machine Learning Model to get Optimal solution, recover Naruto real Estates company from loss and help company to make profit.

In this ML Project Model to predict Optimal Price for houses. Different Field data is used given in the data.csv. 
It is a Supervised Learning problem have to do Regression task. It is a Batch learning problem.
RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) Performance measure is used here.

Python and it's some libraries like Pandas and sklearn are used to predict and provide MEDV value based on the features given to the model.
This Machine Learning Project consists of the following sections-
- Reading data
- Train-Test Splitting
- Looking for Correlations
- Trying out Attribute combinations
- Missing Attributes
- Creating a Pipeline
- Selecting a Desired model for Naruto Real Estates
- Evaluating the Model
- Using better evaluation technique - Cross Validation
- Saving the Model
- Testing the model on test data
- Using Model

Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor and  Random Forest Regressor models are tried in this Machine Learning Project. Random Forest Regressor gave the best Optimal solution for the model. Results from all three Regressors are mentioned in the txt file named Naruto.
Finally, Launched the model with Random Forest Regressor.
